#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) This algorithm runs O(1) or constant time. This algorithm takes input 'a'
and essentially performs a simple set a to equal itself + n times n. Simple math
problem of setting a to a new value. 


b) This algorithm runs O(n) or linear-logarithmic. This algorithm can be broken
into the following:
    sum=0 = constant time, so O(1)
    for i in range = linear time, so O(n)

    j = 1 = constant time for each n in range, so O(1)

    j *= 2 is doubling j by 2, this is constant or O(1)

    sum += 1 is constant time, so O(1)

    total = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + n  with this it is O(n)


c) This algorithm is a recursive function with runtime of O(log n)
